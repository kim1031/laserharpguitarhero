Overview
==============================================================

One of our favorite childhood games is Guitar Hero. One day, whilst reminiscing about the carefree joys of youth, we decided that there was no better way to pay homage to a classic video game like Guitar Hero than to recreate it with an EECS embedded systems twist. Thus, Laser Harp Guitar Hero was born. Instead of pressing buttons and strumming on a contrived, cliche guitar-shaped game controller, users break lasers in order to "pluck" the laser harp and play notes. Players choose from a plethora of songs, including classic Guitar Hero tunes in addition to some of our present-day favorites. The user earns a score based on how well they pluck the notes at the appropriate times, and the system keeps track of the user's name and scores in a server-side database that contains leaderboards for each song. Challenge your friends and determine the true laser harp master!

Below is a video of our group demonstrating the game. How fun!

System Design
==============================================================

Hardware
==============================================================
- 1 ESP32 Microcontroller
- 1 Breadboard
- 1 Micro USB Cable
- 1 Adafruit 5.0" 40-pin TFT Display: 800x480 pixels
- 1 RA8875 Driver Board for 40-pin TFT Touch Displays
- 1 Adafruit 3" Diameter Speaker (4 Ohm 3 Watt)
- 1 DFPlayer Mini MP3 Player
- 1 Micro SD Card
- 4 LEDs (1 green, 1 red, 1 yellow, and 1 blue)
- 4 Lasers
- 4 Phototransistors
- 8 4.7 kÎ© Resistors
- 4 12" blocks of wood
- 1 12" x 12" piece of acrylic
- Wires of various lengths
- 8 Screws
- 4 Nuts
- Electrical tape
- Hot glue
- Shrink wrap
- Zip ties

The 5.0" 40-pin TFT Display and the driver board display the whole graphic user interface for our game. The speaker, MP3 player, and micro SD Card are required to play music. Lasers and phototransistors serve as the strings of the harp. The LEDs help signal a user to break a particular laser at the appropriate time. In addition, both the phototransistors and LEDs require resistors for proper wiring. Finally, we used the wood, acrylic, screws, and nuts to make the laser harp's frame.

1. Start: The user and song information are set to be empty. It shows the home screen introducing Laser Harp Guitar Hero and stays in such state until the first laser (leftmost laser) is broken, in which case we move onto the "Enter Username" state.
2. Enter Username: Using the first three lasers, users can 'type' in their username. Once the fourth laser (rightmost laser) is broken, we move onto the "Choose Song" state.
3. Choose Song: Once again, by using the first two lasers, users can choose the song they want to play. Once the third laser is broken, we move onto the "Play" state.
4. Play: The notes for the song requested is retreived. We stay in this state until the notes recorded for song retrieved finishes playing. Then, we move onto "Show Score" stage.
5. Show Score: We store the user's score in the respective database and print the user's score on screen. When one of the first three lasers are broken, we move onto respective states.
6. Play Again: We keep the same song and user info and move automatically into the "Play" state.
7. New Song: We keep the user but clear the song information and move automatically into the "Choose Song" state.
8. Leaderboard: We retrieve the leaderboard information for the specified song and display it on screen. Based on which laser is broken, move to "Choose Song" or "Start" stage.

Harp Frame
==============================================================
To create a rectangular frame, 4 blocks of wood was used. On the top and bottom pieces of wood, 4 pairs of holes were drilled spaced evenly such that each pair of holes would align vertically with each other. On the top holes, lasers were put in and photoresistors were put in on the bottom. LED holes were made perpendicular to the holes made for lasers on the top piece of wood such that once the LEDs are put in, the user sitting at the front will be able to see them.

To allow the user to have view of the screen and mount the speaker, a piece of acrylic was used. From a rectangular piece of acrylic, two pieces, a rectangle big enough to show the screen and a circle to fit the speaker was cut out to create a design shown as below:

A 3D printed screen holder was used to secure the screen to acrylic. The design of the screen holder is as shown below:


Decision Making and Challenges
==============================================================

Alignment of Lasers and Phototransistors
--------------------------------------------------------------
Our game relies heavily on being able to detect whether or not a laser is broken. For instance, the player must break the laser at the correc time in order to gain points while playing the song. We also use broken lasers as a means of navigating from one page to the other and even selecting a username. Thus, it is crucial that the detection of broken lasers is very accurate. In order to achieve this accuracy, we had to make sure that each laser is pointed exactly at its corresponding phototransistor and that it stayed that way even when we moved the laser harp or the harp was bumped or jostled. We first considered this issue when building the laser harp frame. Firstly, when drilling the holes in the wood for where the lasers and phototransistors would be placed, we tried our very best to make sure that the holes were aligned vertically on top of each other. This was a bit challenging since none of us had much experience with woodwork or power tools, but Tiffany and her MakerLodge training were key. Next, we tried to drill the holes so their diameters were as close as possible to the diameters of the lasers and phototransistors in order to ensure a snug fit. This was also quite difficult because drillbits only come in predetermined sizes, so the holes were a bit too large. In order to attempt to stabilize the lasers and phototransistors, we first tried simply wrapping them in electrical tape in order to increase their diameters so that they fit more snugly inside the holes. However, this didn't work very well because the lasers would still shift over time and could easily be jostled out of position. Thus, we decided to use a combination of this taping method in addition to hot glue. Once the lasers were taped and placed in a position that we liked, we hot glued the top of the wire that stuck out of the hole onto the wooden frame. This still wasn't completely perfect, and some of the lasers had to be adjusted at times, but it worked very reliably for our purposes. For the phototransistors, we decided to forgo the electrical tape and solely use hot glue to secure them since their diameters were already pretty small, so you would have to use a lot of tape to make them fit securely in the holes. We first tested to make sure that phototransistors' measured voltage still changed reliably even when hot glue was placed on top of them. We found that the hot glue had no significant effect on the phototransistors' performance, so we went ahead with our plan. First, we turned on the lasers so we could see where the phototransistors should be placed. Then, we placed hot glue on each phototransistor and secured them to our liking. We also glued the wires that stuck out of the wooden frame into place as well. Thus, our lasers and phototransistors were beautifully aligned and secured!

The Wiring
--------------------------------------------------------------
Having to connect so many wires to the breadboard specifically for the LEDs, lasers, and phototransistors, the wiring often became very messy and it was difficult to find out whether the wiring was done incorrectly or if a wire had been accidently taken out, not to mention the numerous times in which the wires broke. 

In order to prevent such difficulties, we color-coded wires and twisted pairs of wires that go to the same piece. Wires for similar pieces were then also grouped together using tape and zip ties. For lasers, white wires went to power and black wires went to ground. For each 'string,' we attributed different colors, green, red, yellow, and blue, which we represented with LEDs. Wires for the phototransistors were hence set such that white wires always go to power and the wire that goes to the ESP32 is the same as the color it is assigned. Finally, for the LEDs, black wires were used to go to power and accordingly colored wires went to the ESP32.
